## Description 
---

Nowadays, the importance of adding a good README file to all projects which describes it in details is not a secret anymore. A good README file is consisted of a description about the project, the applied technology, the installation and the usage guideline, how to contribute to it, the test and questions parts, the credit section, and the license of that project. This application is written in order to help developpers to authomatically make a good README file only by answering some questions.
